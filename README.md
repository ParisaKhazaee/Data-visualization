# Data-Visualization
To extract knowledge from existing data, it is necessary to know the data well. Also, it is necessary to be aware of the relationships between features, and have an understanding of data behavior. Since this knowledge cannot be reached by looking at the data, it is necessary to make the data understandable. Visualization is a technique that can be used to understand data. With this technique, it is easier to understand the behavior of data and thus use the data correctly to produce knowledge.
The following diagrams can be used for visualization.
Bar plot
Histogram
Pie chart
Scatter plot
and so on
In each part of these project, we use one of the appropriate diagrams according to our needs.
